# RANDOM! 

Are you bored or simply browsing around and looking for something to do? Let RANDOM provide you some entertainment by simply clicking away on four(4) different random categories: advice, activities, dog pictures, and cat pictures.

## How it works

The app is very simple to use, the main menu has four different options to choose from. The user can either choose to view random generated advice, activity, dog pictures, or cat pictures.  Once the user clicks one of the four categories, the user can then either continue viewing the same random generated category that was previously selected or go back to the main menu to select a different category.
